                <p>A staple sandwich of the region is the Po' Boy. It typically comes in bread not unlike a sub sandwich, dressed with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayo, as well as a whole host of different meats, such as fried shrimp, oysters, crab, catfish, crawfish, hot sausage, fried chicken, and roast beef. Seafood po' boys are often dressed with melted butter and sliced pickle rounds. </p>
