                <p>New Orleans was once the capital of French Louisiana before it was traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. It was and still is a major hub city due to it's position on the Mississippi River. It was at one point the third largest city in the US, and was the most populous city in the South prior to WWII. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, it had a population of nearly 500,000, though that number was nearly cut in half after the storm hit. Recovery efforts following the damage have brought that number back to about 400,000 as of 2017. </p>
